Omnipresent Lord,
Thank you for the gift and breath of life this day. Thank you for giving your children a place to lay our heads. Others have no place to sleep at night, please remember them. I pray for your peace and love in my home today.
Please be our surveillance in this house! Protect us from any evil invasion in this house my lord. Let us sleep peacefully and not worry about the enemy.
We commit this house into your care dear lord. Send your angels to be our guards in every room in this house.
Let the walls in this house be as strong as metal, dear Lord. Let your defensive spirit be our soldier in this house.
Even when nobody is home we invite you to stay in this house. Grant us your protective hand and shield us from all evil.
Thank you for answering our prayer, dear Lord...
