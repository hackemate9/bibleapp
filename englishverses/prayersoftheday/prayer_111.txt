Thank You Oh God for guidance and protection every day.
Help us to obey You in every area of our lives so that we will not come out from the umbrella of Your protection.
Thank you for the gifts, abilities, and creativeness You have placed in us.
I pray that we will continue to discover, develop, and refine those gifts and talents and use them for Your purpose alone.
I pray in Jesus' name...
