Lord,
I'm growing old
I'm not that young anymore No longer that strong
But thank you Lord, I am still alive Growing old can be lonely and scarey at times
But I'm ok, I'm fine becasue You're always at my side
Thank you Lord, I have gone this far As You have loved me when I was young, I know You love me more now.
Help me endure the boredom with patience, for my aches and pains are increasing day by day.
Thank you Lord, I have provisions and love from my family and friends,
And thank you for my faith that helps me survive....
