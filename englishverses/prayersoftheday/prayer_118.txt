Dear God,
Thank you so much the gift of life and for allowing me to see another blessed day.
Let this day be the day of miracles. May your Holy Angels protect my family not only fotr today but for everyday.
Please keep my friends safe in Your care. I surrender this day to you Lord.
We may have plans in mind, but let Your will be done in our lives. This I pray in the precious name of Jesus...
