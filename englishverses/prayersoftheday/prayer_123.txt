Father,
I pray that the words of my mouth would be pleasing to you.
I pray that the meditation of my heart would be on things that are true, good, right, pure, and lovely anything that is praise worthy and admirable to you.
Father, I know that it is out of the overflow of my heart that my mouth speaks.
If my heart is not aligned with the things that are pleasing to you, the words of my mouth never will be.
Father, I pray that you will help me in these areas of my life. Thank you, O LORD, you are my rock and my redeemer.
In Jesus Name...
