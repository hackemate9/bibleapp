Dear Father God,
Creator and the Owner of my life. Lord, I have simple requests to you today. Please protect my family and provide all our needs. Please help me to appreciate
everything I have. Lord, as I start this this month of October, I want to thank You for everything. Despite of the struggles in life, I'm still grateful because You're so good to me and to my family. This I pray in the precious name of Jesus...
