Heavenly Father,
Thank You for this new wonderful day and for the new beginning. Thank You for the new hope and strength.
Thank You for all the days of my life and Thank You for all answered prayers.
Lord, I pray for all people who are struggling physically, emotionally, mentally, financially & spiritually.
Maybe at this point of their lives, they don't know what to do.
Please help them and comfort them.
You have seen all their tears. I know tears are prayers too when they can't speak.
Please hear this prayer....
