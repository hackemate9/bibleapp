Almighty Father,
Thank you for my life and for this new day. Thank you also for giving me the opportunity to get closer to you and to feel your love for me. 
Father, under your watchful care, waking up in the morning is a beautiful occasion for me because there is a God ready to embrace, forgive, guide, and strengthen me each day. Thus, continue enlightening, purifying, and enabling my mind and heart with your holy light and healing power.
Deliver me from fearfulness and anxiousness.
Likewise, please grant me the strength that I may forgive those people who had hurt me in the past.
In Jesus' Name...
