Loving Father,
You have loved me when I was unlovable. I am so amazingly grateful that I know You and I can experience Your wonderful presence in my life. Give me this day Your grace in how I live my life today. Give me wisdom and gentleness in how I interact with others. Make me pure then peaceable and gentle. May I have a mind that is open to reason and shows mercy. In
all of today's tasks, grant me the wisdom and grace to be sincere and meek. Thank You that You pour out Your grace to me...
