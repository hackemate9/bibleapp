Dear God,
Good morning! Thank You for waking us up. I'm so grateful today because of You.
Lord, we pray that You will give ussomething of Your patience, so that we may show the same grace and mercy towards those who are in difficulty, depressed & discouraged.
Lord, may You grant us Your grace, so that we may be equipped to forgive others.
Bless & protect our families today & forever.
In Jesus Name...
