Heavenly Father,
Praise, Honor & Thanks be unto You for waking us up this Morning, and allowing us to see the Beauty of another day.
Help us to be what You want us to be, and to say what You want us to say, and when we falther Lord.
Please forgive us, and show us the way.
We want to live Holy unto You.
May You continue to use us for Your glory, favor and prosper us, Heal our bodies, and keep us covered under the Blood of Your Son & our Savior.
In Jesus' name...
