Dear God,
As this day begins, I am grateful to You for waking me up to see a new morning's light.
I humbly ask for Your guidance in my thoughts, actions, and my heart.
Please keep me close to You, never letting me drift away from Your love.
I dedicate all that I have to You and pledge to serve You throughout my life.
I beseech You to watch over me, bestow Your blessings and love upon me.
In Jesus' name, I pray...
