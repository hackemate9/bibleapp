Heavenly Father,
There are so many who love You and want to experience You more and more.
Please pour out Your Spirit upon us O' Lord, and let us know, (in every part of our being) Your grace, Your mercy,
Your power and Your endless love. Thank You God for choosing us, and for teaching us just who You are.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,
we need all of You Lord...
