Dear Lord,
I want to thank you For the blessings you gave to me The love,
joy and happiness The beauty that I see.
I wake up every morning See perfection all around Knowing that a loving God Can easily be found.
It's hard for me to understand The miracles you perform The sunshine and the star lit sky The way the earth was born.
I know a higher Godly one Just took it upon himself To give us all this glory The beauty and the wealth.
I reach out to my precious friends My family and my foe To honor you and thank you For the blessings you bestow.
So when you see a rainbow Stretching out across the sky Be thankful for the gift of love He lives ~ He did not die.
