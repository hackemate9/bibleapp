God our Father,
Hear our morning prayer and let the radiance of your love scatter the gloom of our hearts.
The light of heaven's love has restored us to life; free us from the desires that belong to darkness.
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever....
