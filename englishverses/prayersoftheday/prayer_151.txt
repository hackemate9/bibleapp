Father God,
I'm so grateful today for this great privilege that I can able to bow down my knees in prayer. I'm also grateful for the gift of life that you've given me. Lord, please help me to be more prayerful. Help me to have a better relationship with you. God, if there are times I can't put my prayers into words, please listen to my heart. Please fill this day with answered prayers. In Jesus' Name...
