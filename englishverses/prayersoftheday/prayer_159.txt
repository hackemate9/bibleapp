God,
When things change or something doesn't go as
planned, it is no surprise to You. You are all-knowing. I know that things must change so that I can evolve. I ask You to help me be more open to change. Please help me face my fears by reminding me that I do not ever encounter anything alone. Let Your angels go before me, and at Your Word, let them open the doors You have for me and help me not to be afraid to walk through them as I allow other doors to shut. I want to move forward with You, and I ask that you please help me.
I pray this prayer in Jesus' nameâ€¦
