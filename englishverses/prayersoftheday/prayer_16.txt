Lord,
I pray for your strength as I face the challenges of this day.
I ask that you would give me the physical, emotional, and spiritual strength I need to overcome obstacles and to persevere through difficult moments. I pray that I would be able to find my strength in you, and that I would be able to trust in your power to sustain me. I trust in your goodness and love, and I know that you will give me the strength I need.
In Jesus' name, we pray...
