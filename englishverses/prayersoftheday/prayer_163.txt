Dear God,
Thank you for waking me up today. Thank you for blessing my life with strength, vibrance, peace and joy.
Today is day of miracle.
As we do our task today Lord, guide us that we will be productive and joyful in performing everything.
May Your angels protect our day. Let not weapon of the enemy come near us, instead cover us with the white light of protection
In Jesus name, I pray...
