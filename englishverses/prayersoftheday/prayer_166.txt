Dear God,
As I start this new day, please give me the strength and courage to face any challenges that may come my way.
Help me to remain positive and focused on the tasks ahead of me.
Guide me in all my decisions, that I may choose the right path and make wise choices.
Fill my heart with gratitude for all the blessings in my life, and help me to be a source of kindness and compassion for those around me.
Thank you for the gift of this new day, and for your constant presence in my life...
