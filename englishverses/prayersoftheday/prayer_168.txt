God,
Please instruct and teach me as I seek to live a life that honors You. 
I ask that You will guide me into my calling, and lovingly correct my mistakes.
Thank You for being the One I can always confide in, and for loving me as I am.
You are a good God, and I am grateful for You.
In Jesus' name...
