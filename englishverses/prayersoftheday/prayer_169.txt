Dear God,
I want to thank You for the home that you have provided for my family.
Lord, as I go to my daily task today, I will be diligent in my duties & work with a heart of praise to You & for Your multiplied grace towards me.
Lord, give me strength & keep me from the temptations of the world. 
May this day be a day that I grow in love & in faith. This I pray in the precious name of Jesus, my Savior...
