Dear God,
I'm so grateful today because You are so good to me. I'm so grateful not only for your goodness but also foryour faithfulness and for being so gracious to me. God, You know our problems and struggles. We need Your help. Please give us strength so we will not easily give up. Give us hope even in the midst of our disappointments. This I pray,
In Jesus Name...
