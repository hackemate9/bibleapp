Dear God,
Thank you so much for the Gift of Life and for allowing me to witness another blessed day.
I pray that today is the day of miracles.
May you send Your Holy Angels to protect my family not only for today but for everyday and keep my friends and loved ones safe in Your care.
As I begin this day Lord, I choose to surrender all my plans to You and let Your will be done in me.
Bless this day ahead and keep us safe.
In Jesus' Name, I pray...
