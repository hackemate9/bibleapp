I pray Hebrews 13:5 over my life. I desire to be free from the love of money. Father, let me not crave earthly possessions, but instead Your will and Your way only. Help me become content with all my circumstances, and satisfied with exactly what I have. Let me always remember to be thankful for the provision You have provided and the blessings You have given me. Father, thank you for Your promises to me. I trust that You will never leave me, fail me, or forsake me. I know that You will never leave me helpless. You will always meet me at my need. I know that I can have comfort and peace, because You have a firm grip on me and my life.
In Jesus Name...
