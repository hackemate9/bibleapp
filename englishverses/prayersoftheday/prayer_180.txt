God,
You are the foundation upon which I build my life. You are my source of protection and strength.
You fight for me, protect me, and lead me through hard times.
With You, I am never alone or abandoned.
Thank You for being my source of strength and salvation. Thank You for crushing the devil's schemes and guiding me closer to You.
In Jesus' name...
