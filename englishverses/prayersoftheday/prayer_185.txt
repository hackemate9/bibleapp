Heavenly Father,
It's another day, another blessing, and another opportunity to give You praise.
Thank You painting another beautiful Sunrise for us to see this morning.
We thank You in advance for opening doors for all who need jobs, for healing the sick, for mending broken hearts, and for dispatching Your Angels to keep us safe today.
In Jesus' name...
