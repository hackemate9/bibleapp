Heavenly Father,
Thank you for my life. Thank you for sustaining me all these years. You have been faithful and loving to me. I pray that you
sanctify my body. Let me be a recipe for divine healing. Let my body be a place of good health.
Remove any contamination from my body. Resist all viral, bacterial, or cancerous infections from my body. Take dominion
over what enters my body and let your spirit protect me from all evil plots on my health,
in the mighty name of Jesus...
