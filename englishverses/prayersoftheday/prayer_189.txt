Lord,
I pray for your humility as I go about my day.
I ask that you would help me to be humble in my interactions with others, and that I would be able to see my own weaknesses and flaws.
I pray that I would be able to learn from my mistakes, and that I would be able to grow in humility as I follow your example.
I trust in your humility and provision, and I pray that I would experience that humility in a powerful way today.
In Jesus' name, we pray...
