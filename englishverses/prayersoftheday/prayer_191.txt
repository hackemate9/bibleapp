Heavenly Father,
Today we come to You with a thankful heart filled with love and peace. You are good and Your love endures forever.
Your word tells us that all of us must have a close relationship with You.
Today we ask that You draw us closer to You, for we know that You are the source of all that we have, and will ever need.
Help us today to love as You do and not do anything for our own selfish ambitions.
Rather in humility help us to follow Your word for we know that it has the power to heal and transform every area of our life.
Draw us, and those around us closer to You today as the Holy Spirit continues to lead our way.
In Jesus' name we pray...
