Father God,
It is by Your divine grace that we have lived to the end of another day. Thank You for this &, I am sure, many more blessings than we even know. Lord, we lift us our loved ones who need Your healing hand & thank You for their complete restoration.
Lord, we pray for our loved ones who do not know You. We ask You reveal Yourself to them that they may come to know You. Thank You for the blessings & all the things that life will bring tomorrow. Thank You for Your preparing us with all we will need. Bless You, Lord, You are a wonderful God! In Jesus' name...
