Our most gracious, Kind and loving Heavenly Father,
Creator of visible and invisible things.
Lord, thank you so much for all the blessings that you have given me.
Thank you for always providing my needs. And above all, thank you for always giving me good health.
Even though sometimes I struggle financially, but I'm still grateful because of the good health that you have given me.
Lord, please keep my family safe always. That's my only request for today. 
In Jesus' Name...
