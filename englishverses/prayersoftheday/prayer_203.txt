Dear Lord,
You are my strength, my hope, and my joy.
I need You always. Please protect my family, friends, and anyone reading this.
I pray that God's hand will never cease to help us through the difficult times in our lives.
May God alleviate our pain, worries, and problems, and replace them with health, happiness, and peace....
