God,
This morning I wake and
I thank You. For the gift of seeing a new day begin, and the energy I'll need, to make it through today. When the day is over and night time comes, I will thank You. For the gift of knowing a day has been well- spent and for the tranquility that comes with a darkened sky. Morning to night, a precious cycle. I am each day, ever grateful...
