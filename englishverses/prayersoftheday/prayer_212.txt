Dear Lord,
Thank you so much for including my name in Your wake up list this morning. I made it today because You have plans for me and I trust your way. Though at times, I may not understand the happenings of my life, yet I will choose to believe in You Lord. Let this day be the day that I will receive an answer to all my prayers, healing to pains and joy to all my sufferings.
In Jesus Name, I pray...
