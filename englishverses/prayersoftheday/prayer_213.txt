God,
You have never abandoned or betrayed me. You have faithfully cared for me and defended me. There is no one like You! When I look at nature, I see Your creativity. And when I look at my life, I see Your love. Even on the hardest of days, You are near. And that's why today, I want to tell the whole world what You've done and who you are! In Jesus' name...
