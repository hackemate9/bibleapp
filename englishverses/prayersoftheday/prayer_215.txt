Dear God,
Good morning! Thank You for waking me up. I'm so grateful today because of You. Lord, I pray that You will give me something of Your patience, so that I may show the same grace and mercy towards those who are in difficulty, depressed &
discouraged. Lord, may You grant me Your grace, so that I may be equipped to forgive others. Bless & protect my family today & forever. In Jesus Name...
