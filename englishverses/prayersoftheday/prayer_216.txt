Father,
Please heal me from every sickness and disease aches and pains. Lord God, bring wholeness and wellness to every cell in my body. Father, drive out everything in me that should not be. Father, let every organ in my body work the way it should. Father, please heal me today. In Jesus' name, I pray...
