Dear Lord,
Thank you for waking me up this morning. thank you for your love and care. thank you for everything you have freely given me in this life. As I set to go and perform the work you have blessed my hands to do. I thank you for protecting me from anything that may come my way. Thank you for your grace that will keep me through this day...
