God,
I am honored to be Yours, and I'm grateful that when You created the universe- You thought of me and decided to give me life. Each day, I'm in awe of Your goodness, power, and love for Your people. Thank You for sending Your only Son to the cross so I could have a relationship with You. I love You, Lord. In Jesus' name...
