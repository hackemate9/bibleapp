Heavenly Father,
I come before you today asking for forgiveness of my sins. Lord, thank you for giving me another day to live. My only request to You this morning is to bless my family and friends. Strengthen their faith. Let them live with contentment and rejoice in gladness. Protect them spiritually, physically, mentally, and emotionally. This I pray in JESUS name...
