Father God,
Thank You for this new wonderful day. Lord, I have so many things to do today. I hope & I pray that I may glorify Your name in my daily activities. Thank You for Your generous provision. Be with all those that are facing hardship today. Have mercy on them & may You provide their needs too. Thank You, that You have promised to provide all our needs according to Your riches & grace. In Jesus Name...
