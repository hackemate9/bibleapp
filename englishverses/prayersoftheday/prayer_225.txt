Dear God, today,
I completely surrender my all to you. I lift my hands and open my
To you, heart. Assist me in relying on you in whatever I do. Please direct my thoughts and behaviors and take command of my life. 
Assist me in comprehending your words and focusing my heart on you. Lord, go beside me and direct my ways. In all I do, provide me with knowledge, strength, and guidance. Bring me to the life you have prepared for me by guiding me through the pitfalls of life. Allow your will to be done in my life at
all times...
