Oh mighty Lord,
The enemy rises like a river To knock me down.
It's all too much for me. Alone, I will be crushed. So here and now, I cry out to you, Defend me, oh Lord!
Free me from the enemy! Strike down the evil one.
Cast him out into the abyss. Jesus Christ is my Savior and King. To him I owe my life and my soul. Despite the difficulty
I will praise his holy name. In the name of Jesus Christ I declare the enemy Powerless with no influence Over my life. I have been saved
By the Blood of the Lamb. Through the wounds of Christ I am at peace with God. Christ resurrected is my Lord, And his Spirit my protector. I bow in the dirt to his will. May the mighty hand of God Strike down the enemy And crush the serpent's head. In the name of the Lord, Jesus...
