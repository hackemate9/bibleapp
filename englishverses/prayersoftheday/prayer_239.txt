Father,
You have given me the gift of both eyes that look and ears that hear, and I am so thankful for your gifts. I pray I would see with eyes of the Spirit. Father, I desire the ability to look deeper into people and situations. Let me see with eyes of compassion and humility. When I look at others let me see them the way you do, not seeing their errors or faults, but only the good within them. Father, will you please
heighten my looking into seeing, so I may help the hurting and see the lost. Lord, do not let me be blinded to my own faults, when I look in the mirror, let me see myself the way you see me. Father, I pray for spiritual ears that are trained to hear Your Word and Your Way, and are able to distinguish truth from lie. I pray that they would become deaf to gossip, slander, and blasphemy, but always delight in worship. I pray for eyes and ears that operate with spiritual discernment at all times. Father, I desire to use both of these senses to serve you in excellence and to be a blessing to others.
In Jesus Name...
