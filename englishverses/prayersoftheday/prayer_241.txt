Almighty God,
I come to you today because you are my refuge and my safe haven. 
The difficulties I'm facing and the troubles of this world are making life unbearable for me. Lord, I am weary, weak, and tired.
Please send down your Holy Spirit to come and fuel me and restore my strength. I can't go on without you, Lord, I need you in my life.
I need, your strength, I need your power, you my and your courage to move on in life. Help me to always look up to and not worry about problems.
Help me to persevere and not give up on life.
Give me the strength to keep fighting and most importantly give me the patience to wait on you to change my story.
Thank you, Father, for hearing my prayer...
