OH, God
I dwell in the midst of the infinite abundance. The abundance of God is my Infinite source.
The river of life never stops flowing.
If flows through me into lavish expression.
Good comes to me through expected and unexpected avenues.
God works in generous and bountiful ways to bless me.
I now open my mind to receive my good.
Nothing is too good to be true. Nothing is too wonderful to happen. With God as my source, nothing amazes me.
I give freely and fearlessly into life and life give back to me with fabulous increase.
Blessings come in expected and unexpected ways.
God provides for me in wondrous ways. I am grateful. And so it is...
