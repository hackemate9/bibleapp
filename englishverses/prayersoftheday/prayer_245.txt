Dear Lord,
Today I thank You for keeping all those I love protected, safe, and healthy.
You've blessed us, and today we place our trust in You to guide us and carry us through whatever we may face.
Please keep my family, my friends, my home, and those reading this in Your perfect care that can only come from You.
In Jesus' name, we pray...
