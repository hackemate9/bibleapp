Almighty Father,
Thank You for this day. Father, I put my life into Your guiding and life-giving hands; be with me and always at work in me. Father, entrusting myself to You is the best thing I can do for myself because You are the owner of my life, and You know all the things inside my heart - my fears and doubts, my pains and wounds, and my deepest desires and hopes. Father, today, I lift up to You my plans and goals for my life and my family; please assist me in bringing them into reality. Likewise, bless my heart with Your divine strength so that I may not be easily discouraged when my plans do not immediately turn out the way I expected them to happen; help me to see that everything happens for a reason and purpose. In Jesus' Name...
