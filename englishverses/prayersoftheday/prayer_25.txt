Father God,
Thank You so much for bringing us through another beautiful day. Lord, before we start this day, we confess to You all our sins that We have committed against Thee. Please forgive us & cleanse us with the blood of Christ. Lord, starting today, we choose not to worry over the things that are beyond our control. We place everything in Your hands because we cant rely on our own strength. Please bless us now & forever. In Jesus Name...
