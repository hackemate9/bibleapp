Dear God,
Please hear and answer our prayers as we get ready to start the day. I pray that you walk beside us all today so that we can overcome any obstacle that gets in our way.
Please give relief to anyone that carries a heavy burden today. May you allow them to rest in comfort and relieve whatever troubles them.
We thank you for everything that do to help us. Please see us through the day and return us home safely tonight.
In Jesus'name...
