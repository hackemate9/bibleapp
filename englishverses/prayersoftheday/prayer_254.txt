Good Morning, God!
You are ushering in another day. Untouched and freshly new
So here I come to ask You, God, If you'll renew me, too.
Forgive the many errors That I made yesterday,
And let me try again, dear God, To walk closer in Thy Way....
But, Father, I am well aware
I can't make it on my own So take my hand and hold it tight For I can't walk alone...
