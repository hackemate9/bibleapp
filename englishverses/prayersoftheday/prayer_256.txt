Dear Lord,
Thank You for Your grace and strength that has seen me through this week. Thank You for being my refuge and fortress in times of trouble. Thank You for being The One I can always turn to and rely on. You are always so faithful to fulfill Your promises. I am thankful and grateful for all You do for me
In Jesus' name I pray...
