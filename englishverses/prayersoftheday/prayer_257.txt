Dear God,
I want to first thank You for all the blessings You've given me. I ask forgiveness for my sins.
My life is Yours, I give it all to You. Make me white as snow. Refresh my mind and my soul.
Heal me of my aches and pains. I ask that You shower my family and friends with blessings and protection.
I love and want you in my life. In Jesus name, I pray....
