Father,
Thank You for being near to all of us who call on You, and to all who call on You in truth. We draw near to You, knowing that You are ever near to us. We confess the times when we doubted You were there, but we realize now that it was us who had moved away and not You. Father, we ask that you help us to pray more fervently, especially during the times when we do not hear an answer to our prayers. Help us focus more on Your Word, and to trust you to deliver us from all doubts and fears. Thank You Father that Your Word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path.
In Jesus' name...
