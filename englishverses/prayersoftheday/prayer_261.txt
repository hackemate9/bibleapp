Heavenly Father,
In a world where darkness persists, we find our refuge in You, the victorious One.
We lift Your name on high, extolling Your greatness as the Alpha and Omega, the Eternal King.
Sin may surround us, but it holds no dominion over Your power. We're grateful for Jesus, our Savior, who conquered death's grasp, granting us liberty from sin's chains.
May our lives forever resonate with the joy of this triumph, living in the light of Your grace.
In Jesus' name, we pray...
