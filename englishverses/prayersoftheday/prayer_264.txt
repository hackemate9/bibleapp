Father God,
Thank you for your unconditional love, for sending Jesus to save me and to set me free. I surrender myself to your power and grace to sustain and restore me.
Loving Father, touch me now with Jesus healing hands as I believe that your will is for me to be well in mind, body and spirit.
Cover me with the most precious blood of Jesus from the top of my head to the soles of my feet.Cast out anything that should not be in me.
Root out any unhealthy and abnormal cells and multiply the healthy ones. Open any blocked arteries or veins, rebuild and replenish any damaged areas.
Remove all inflammation and cleanse any infection by the power of Jesus precious blood. Let the fire of your healing love pass through my entire body enriching its function.
Touch also my mind and my emotions even the deepest recesses of my heart. Saturate my whole being with your presence, joy and peace and draw me ever closer to you every moment of my life, confirming that the Holy Spirit dwells in me, telling me what to do...
