I give you thanks for waking me up on this glorious day.
Thank You for the miracle of life. Thank You for the protection not just for me, but for my family as well.
May You continue to rain Your blessings, miracles, and healing on us.
We ask for Your presence to lead us and give us the strength to perform our duties and responsibilities.
In Jesus' name...
