Father God in Heaven,
Thank you for all the blessings that You have given me, specially for the gift of life. Lord, I need you today.
I know I can't do all things without you. I want to be fully dependent on You, for I know you will help me and guide me in every thing I do and in every place I go.
Help me not to get discouraged. I know Your ways are perfect. Please bless me with more faith, hope and strength.
This I pray in Jesus' name...
