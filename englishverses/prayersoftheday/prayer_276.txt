Lord,
To you, be all the glory and adoration.
Thank you for all you have done in my life.
Thank you for the unseen protection you have given me.
Lord, I know you have chosen me as your own. You have shown me your salvation through your grace.
Your mighty hands have delivered me from harm's way and have redeemed my soul unto
you.
Lord, I know I cannot achieve anything without you.
So today, I make this confession to love and cherish your ways.
Father, help me always to seek and serve you. You have promised to bless those who fervently worship you.
Therefore, let my blessing not elude me. Lord, I ask for an Abrahamic kind of blessings. Thank you, Father, for answering my prayers...
