Dear God,
what a pleasure it is to follow You and to accomplish whatever You have instructed me to do. I want to follow the example You set.
I desire to stay on the right path, resist temptation, and follow You. Give me the ability to inspire, love, and set an example for others.
I ask that you protect me and lead me. Help me to walk in perfect obedience to Your Word.
As I travel this path, may I be obedient and reap the benefits.
In the Mighty Name of Jesus, I pray...
