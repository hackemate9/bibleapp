Dear Lord,
Thank You for another beautiful sunrise. Every breath I take is a gift from You. Thank you Lord, no matter what I face today with Your help, I know I will be able to endure, overcome and prevail.
I thank you in advance for Your strength and energy that will sustain me, Your wisdom that will guide me and Your peace that will fill me.
May this day be filled with so many blessings, miracles and answered prayers.
In Jesus' Name I pray...
