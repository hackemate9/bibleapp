Lord,
It's me again.
Thank you for helping me sleep through the night and waking me up to this beautiful morning. Lord, I pray that you teach me to love my life with each passing day.
Fill my heart with joy and gladness and remind me of all the things in my life to be thankful for.
When thoughts of negativity begin to fill my mind, please remind me that you love me.
When I begin to feel helpless and hopeless, please remind me that you've got me.
When I feel like I hate my life, please remind me that you created me for a purpose.
Mold and guide me to your purpose for me, because I trust that your plans for me are better than anything I could ever ask for.
In Jesus' name, I pray...
