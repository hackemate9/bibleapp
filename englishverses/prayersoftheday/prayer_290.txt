Father,
I pray that I would become a person who is quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry.
I believe anger can destroy households, ruin relationships, and hinder spiritual growth.
Please help me surrender myself to your Word, becoming humble and possessing a gentle and quiet Spirit. I know the worst emotion I can bring to any situation is anger.
Help me to open my ears and my heart so that I can learn what you have to teach me in these hard situations.
Help me to grow and exercise self control.
Father, I desire to live a righteous life, one that is pleasing to you.
In Jesus Name...
