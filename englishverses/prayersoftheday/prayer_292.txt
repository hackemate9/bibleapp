Lord,
You know my heart in and out, and you know that my heart is tired, but it is not fully resting in you.
My patience wears thin with the weight of the world.
For this Sunday morning, please free me of any burden of impatience I may have for what is going on in life around me.
Help me to have patience like you Lord, and help
me to replace any impatience with empathy like Jesus...
