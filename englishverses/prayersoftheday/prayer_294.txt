Lord,
I'm grateful for Your grace and mercy.
Your Word tells me that eternal life is knowing the Lord Jesus Christ Whom You have sent to be my Lord and Savior.
I pray that I will learn to spend more time listening to Your Word, and communing with You in Your presence.
I pray that You will win my heart, teach me Your ways, and bring me even closer to You.
Give me a heart that desires to learn more about You and the timeless truths of Your priceless Word.
In Jesus name, I pray...
