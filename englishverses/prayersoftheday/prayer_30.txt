Loving heavenly Father,
Even after knowing You, I wallowed in my sins, unrighteous and deceitful acts. Help me to leave the dirty life and cling on to You. I was slothful in things concerning You. I ask Your forgiveness for all the days I went far from You. Draw me closer to You.
Help me to abide in You and bear much fruits for You. Let Your name be glorified in me.
In Jesus' name...
