Heavenly Father,
Thank You for another blessed day and week.
Please wrap Your arms around all of Your children, and keep them safe from harm. We place our loved ones, homes, work places, finances, and all vehicles into Your capable hands.
May You continue to heal the sick, comfort those who mourn, and keep us covered under the Precious blood of Jesus....
