Lord,
I ask for your guidance today as I set out for better opportunities than yesterday. Do not let me stray from my path for You're my shepherd, oh Lord. Let Your staff prevent me from any error and let Your eyes watch over me and protect me from all danger. You're the only God and no matter is too big for You Lord. So, let flattened all issues that may plague my day.
