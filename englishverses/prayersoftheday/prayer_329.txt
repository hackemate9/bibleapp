I pray to You my Father above, that You influence all decisions I, my family, and my friends make today. You're our pillar of support and we want You to support us throughout the day by giving us the capacity. God, we need You to back all actions and decisions that surround us today. Let positivity follow us, oh Lord. And allow us the wisdom to avoid any negative occurrence in our time of need. We thank You, Lord, for gracing us with Your presence.
