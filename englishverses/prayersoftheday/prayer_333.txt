Today is a new day and it's filled with different possibilities. I pray that You oh Lord in above perform miracles in the life of “insert name.” He/she shall not lack and any mountain set before him/her today shall be reduced to a stepping stone. As today ends, let songs of praises be sung in Your Holy Name. Miracles, blessings, and divine protection will “name” have in each and every one of his/her days. I exalt You Lord and I thank You for the grace.
