God,
Help me love the life I live right now. Show me the good things I often overlook and help me be content with what I have. Forgive me when I compare myself to others, forgive me for longing for things outside of You and Your kingdom. Thank You for loving me right where I am, right as I am. Help me keep my eyes on You.
In Jesusâ€™ name...
