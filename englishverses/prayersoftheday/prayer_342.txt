Dear Lord~
Help us to remember we are called to live our lives in faith. Help us not to live our lives in fear when the things of this world seam so out of control.
Help us to find our comfort in you when the ground we walk on seams so shaky. Protect us and calm our fearful hearts. Give us strength and courage to face the things that are unknown to us but fully known to you.
