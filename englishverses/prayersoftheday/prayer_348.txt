Dear Lord~
In this season of confusion, chaos, uncertainty, heaviness, and sadness that we are in- Help us to remember to fix our eyes on you. That we would seek you moment by moment for your guidance first in all circumstances.
Help us to remember that we are not self reliant, that we cannot rely on the things of this world. Lord you are in control of this fallen world. Help us to remember to rely on your word and your love for us.
