Lord Jesus,
Here I am. I trust in You. You are my God.
My life is in Your hands!
You know my heart.
You know my cares. You know my worries. You know the things that make me afraid.
Lord Jesus,
With Your mighty hands, supply my needs.
As You fed the thousands, healed the sick,
calmed the storm, and
raised the dead,
so keep me, O Lord, my God...
