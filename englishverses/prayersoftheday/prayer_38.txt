Dear Lord,
You are my strength in the midst of trouble. Thank You because even in my difficult situation, You never leave me. Thank you for always reminding me that should trust you with all my heart. Thank You for carrying me through when I can't go on. Words cannot express how thankful I am for all that you've done in my life. May You visit us today with healing & blessing. Keep us safe throughout the day. In Jesus' name...
