Our most gracious & loving heavenly Father, Thank You for waking me up.
Thank you for making my life so meaningful. Lord, fill my heart with Your gifts. Help me in all my needs & grant me wisdom to do what is right. Please guide me when I am in doubt, protect me when I am tempted & console me when I am afraid. We are hoping that one day, pain will end & tears will stop. In Jesus' mighty name...
