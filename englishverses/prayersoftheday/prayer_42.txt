Dear Heavenly Father,
I want to express my gratitude for granting me another day to live under Your grace. I pray for Your guidance in calming my worries when things feel uncontrollable and for the strength
to trust in Your plans.
Please help me remain focused on Your word, and I humbly ask for the ability to be obedient to Your will.
In Jesus' name...
