Heavenly Father,
I come before You today to pray for every member of my family. I pray You bless each and every one of them with their heart desires. If any of them is going through hard times, please deliver them and restore them with your blessings. Please let them remember You in times of need. It is through You that all good things come. I pray You bless them with good things in life. Please order their steps so they can be at the right place at the right time. Protect them from any evil plans of the enemy and all bad fortunes. I trust You to answer my prayers, through Jesus...
