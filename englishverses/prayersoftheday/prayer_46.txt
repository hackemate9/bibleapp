Lord,
thank You for this day.
Many are the troubles of the day, but You are there to defend me from them.
I believe that You will always be there, Lord and You will never let me be put to shame. I ask forgiveness for the sins I had committed. Restore my soul, Lord.
Revive me. Bring me to life.
As I sleep tonight, may my body attain the rest it needed, to push on for another day...
