Dear Heavenly Father,
As the sun rises and a new day begins, I humbly come before You in prayer.
Fill my heart with gratitude for the gift of life and the blessings that surround me. Grant me strength and wisdom to face the challenges ahead. Guide my thoughts, words, and actions,
that they may reflect Your love and bring hope to others. May Your grace and peace be with me throughout this day.
In Your holy name, I pray...
