Almighty God,
You are merciful, full of love and great is Thy raithfulness. I come before your throne of grace asking for frogiveness of my sins. I am not worthy, but you shed your blood for me. Thank you for loving me unconditionally. Lord, help me love the life I live right now. Show me the good things I often overlook, and help me be content with what I have. Forgive me when I compare myself to others, forgive me for longing for things outside of You and Your kingdom. Thank You for loving me.
In Jesus' name I pray...
