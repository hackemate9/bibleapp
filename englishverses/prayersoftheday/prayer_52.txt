Everywhere I walk,
let it be on your path. Everything I see, let it be through your eyes. Everything I do, let it be your will.
For every hardship I face, let me place it in your hands.
Every emotion I feel, let it be your spirit moving in me.
Everything I seek, let me find it in your love.
My dear God, I thank you for this day. I will not ask where I am going. 
But only to know and feel in the depths of my heart and soul that you are with me.
You are guiding me, and I am safe. In God' name, I offer myself to you...
