Gracious Lord,
In all I do, I pray for your wisdom and guidance.
I entrust you with all of my daily tasks.
Assist me in making the best judgments possible in life.
Teach me to recognize and comprehend the advantages and disadvantages of anything I do.
Guide my decisions so that I always make the best choices that will lead me closer to my life's purpose.
Assist me with letting go of what isn't working in my life.
Teach me to concentrate on what will bring me happiness in you. 
Thank you very much for responding to my prayers.
In Jesus' name...
