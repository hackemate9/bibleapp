God,
It can be difficult to love those who have mistreated me, but I know You love them-so I want to love them too.
Encourage me to pray for those I am too hurt to be around.
Give me the courage to go out of my way and to be kind to those who are unkind.
And provide me with the strength I need to forgive them.
You are the Judge- not me and I am just as unworthy of Your love.
In Jesus' name...
