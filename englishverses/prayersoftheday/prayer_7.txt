Heavenly Father,
Please forgive me for not appreciating your grace and presence in my life. Make me aware of the many gifts You have given me so that I may respond to them and give You what you deserve: my heartfelt thanksgiving. Please guide my faith and continue making me humble and respectful just like the leper who came back to Jesus to thank Him for healing them. Renew my heart, that I may receive your blessings gratefully and share my thanks plentifully, that I may live fully in your way. I praise You for your selfless love, your abundant mercy, your costly grace, your faithfulness to your promises, and your assurance of my future with You. May I always be thankful for your never-ending blessings, healing powers and forgiveness through your Son, Jesus...
