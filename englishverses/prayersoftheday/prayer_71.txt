Heavenly Father,
I thank you you to for my life.
Today, I come before pray about the setbacks in my life. No matter how hard I try, things just seem to be going downhill for me. So I come to you in prayer.
I receive the power of divine restoration in Jesus' name. I decree and declare that no weapon fighting against my life shall prosper.
I fire back any evil arrow that has been shot at me. By the blood of Jesus, whatever evil arrow fired against my destiny, backfire.
Any evil power working against my life be consumed by the Holy Spirit. I decree and declare that by the power of the blood, I shall bounce back.
I declare victory over my life and everything I do in Jesus name...
