Father in Heaven,
Thank you very much for everything you do for me. Thank you for constantly guiding and safeguarding me.
Please forgive me for not seeking your counsel first while making decisions always.
Take command of my life and direct my steps.
As you guide me to success and prosperity, please make it possible for me to follow your path. In all I do, grant me wisdom and understanding.
When you speak to me, teach me to hear and understand your
voice.
In Jesus' name...
