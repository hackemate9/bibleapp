Heavenly Father,
I may not understand how everything will work out, but I trust you.
I don't see a way, but I know you will make a way I have faith at this very moment you are touching hearts, opening doors and lining up the right breaks and right opportunities.
Things may look dark and bleak now, but
I have faith that my dawn is coming...
