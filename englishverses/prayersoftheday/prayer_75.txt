Dear God,
Today, I ask for your will to be done in my life and that of my loved ones. I trust that your guidance will lead me where it is I am supposed to go.
Your protection and love will cover me. So I don't have to seek it out anywhere other than you.
God, please allow me to open doors only you can open. Allow me to walk with authority because you have declared it.
I am built for this.
There is nothing I can't do with you on my side. God, swaddle me in your eternal power so I may walk boldly in victory today and remember who sent me...
