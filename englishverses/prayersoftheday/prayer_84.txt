Dear Lord,
You know what I am worried about.
You know how I can't stop thinking about everything.
I am stressed, unsettled, and worried about what's going to happen. 
Please take away the "what if's".
Please take control of this situation and guide me one day at the time. Help me to focus my thoughts on You and not worry about what could happen.
Please give me Your wisdom and fill me with Your peace...
