Father,
Thank you. Father, you are the God of love, joy, peace, and power. Right now Father, we come to you asking for a refreshing.
Refresh us and strengthen us.
Father, we need your love, power, and presence to overwhelm us.
We need your wisdom to lead and guide us.
We need your strength to carry us through.
Father, you for refreshing us today.
In Jesus name I pray...
