Thank You, Heavenly Father,
For the opportunity and gift of prayer. I'm grateful that I can go to Your throne of grace when I need assistance.
Please rekindle in me a daily desire to grow in my knowledge of and love for You.
Remove from me any small-minded attitudes that might impede my relationship with You.
Give me a stronger desire to spend time in Your company and to continually give You honor in spirit and truth.
And cultivate a spirit of worshipful prayer in my heart so that my relationship with You becomes the core of my entire existence.
This I ask in Jesus' name...
